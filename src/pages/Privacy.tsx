You may also provide additional, optional information so that We can provide You a more customized experience when using the Site –but, We will leave that decision with You. If you subscribe to certain Services additional information such as billing address and payment information will also be required. Once You submit the required registration information, We alone will determine whether or not to approve Your proposed Account. If approved, You will be sent an e-mail detailing how to complete Your registration. For so long as You use the Account, You agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete information which can be accomplished by logging into Your Account and making relevant changes directly or contacting Us using the below contact information and We can make the changes for You.

Between You and ALBERTai, You are solely responsible for entering into a business associate agreement with any entity if, in Your sole interpretation, one is necessary to disclose or receive information to that entity.
